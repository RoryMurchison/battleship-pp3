# Battleships

This game of battleship takes inspiration from the classic boardgame and puts its own spin on it. This version of battleship is played within a Python terminal, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. Designed as a single player game, the user must find all the computers randomly placed ships (2-5 in length), within their given amount of turns.

## How to play

The user will be presented with a grid consisting of ".".
The "." is used to represent an area of the grid which is unknown.
Enemy ships have been placed randomly on this board but are hidden to the user.
The user will then proceed to be prompted to guess a set of coordinates on the grid.
Assuming the guess is valid, the game will then reveal if you have hit or miss an enemy ship.
A "#" will be used to represent a missed attempt.
A "X" will be used to represent a hit.
A running counter will show how many more ships are left to sink and how many turns remain.
If all ships are sunk before you run out of turns, then you win!
